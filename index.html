              Daniela Arancibia is a principal for a local elementary school.
              After graduating as a teacher in 2011, she moved abroad and began
              teaching kindergarten. After years of dedication and helping young
              minds grow and learn new skills, she also started teaching in the
              summer programs. Daniela always wanted to teach under privileged
              kids. While in school, she always made the comment that she would
              like to teach in remote poor areas.
