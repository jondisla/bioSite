            Daniela Arancibia is a principal for a local elementary school.
            After graduating as a teacher in 2011, she moved abroad and began
            teaching kindergarten. After years of dedication and helping young
            minds grow and learn new skills, she also started teaching in the
            summer programs. Daniela always wanted to teach under privileged
            kids. While in school, she always made the comment that she would
            like to teach in remote poor areas.
