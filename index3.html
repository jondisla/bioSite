                Daniela Arancibia is a principal for a local elementary school.
                After graduating as a teacher in 2011, she moved abroad and
                began teaching kindergarten. After years of dedication and
                helping young minds grow and learn new skills, she also started
                teaching in the summer programs. Daniela always wanted to teach
                under privileged kids. While in school, she always made the
                comment that she would like to teach in remote poor areas.

                A lot of parents attend the school she teaches at just because
                they know that she will do a good job teaching their kids.
                However, there were some challenges Daniela had to face on the
                road to where she is now. As a decision maker however, Daniela
                has managed to inspire her team to achieve better results for
                her team of teachers.
